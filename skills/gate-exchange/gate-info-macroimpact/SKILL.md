# gate-info-macroimpact

## General Rules

⚠️ STOP — You MUST read and strictly follow the shared runtime rules before proceeding.
Do NOT select or call any tool until all rules are read. These rules have the highest priority.
→ Read [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md)
→ Also read [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md) for **gate-info** / **gate-news**-specific rules (tool degradation, report standards, security, routing degradation, and per-skill version checks when `scripts/` is present).
- **Only call MCP tools explicitly listed in this skill.** Tools not documented here must NOT be called, even if they
  exist in the MCP server.

> The Macro-Economic Impact Analysis Skill. When the user asks about the impact of macro data/events on the crypto market, the system calls MCP tools in parallel to fetch economic calendar, macro indicators (or summary), related news, and correlated coin market data, then the LLM produces a structured correlation analysis report.

**Trigger Scenarios**: User mentions macroeconomic events/indicators and crypto market impact, e.g., "how does non-farm payroll affect BTC", "any macro data today", "Fed meeting impact on the market", "has CPI been released".

**Per-skill updates:** This directory includes `scripts/update-skill.sh` and may include `scripts/update-skill.ps1`. **ClawHub** packages uploaded to the marketplace often omit `update-skill.ps1` (upload-page restriction); **GitHub / Bitbucket** source trees keep both. Policy: [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md) §1. The **Trigger update** steps below apply in addition to [gate-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/gate-runtime-rules.md); when scripts are present, use this flow for version checks before execution.

**Update check — user visibility:** Technical failures during version check (missing script, sandbox, network, non-zero exit, no parseable `Result=` line) must **not** be explained to the user; continue with Execution per [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md). Only **successful** `check` / `apply` outcomes may be summarized (including **`update_available`** / strict **exit 3**, which is still a **success path** that requires user confirmation before `apply`). **Do not** auto-download `update-skill.*` from the network. **Static reference** if `.ps1` is missing: canonical scripts live in [gate/gate-skills](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills) under `skills/<name>/scripts/` (same `<name>` as frontmatter).

---

## Trigger update (with Execution)

**Default (PD / blocking):** On each trigger, run **`check`** first **without** **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`**. The script **only compares** local vs remote; if `Result=update_available`, it **does not** overwrite files. **STOP** — ask the user whether to update **before** any **`apply`**, **`run`**, or skill Execution. In sandboxes (e.g. Cursor), use **full / all permissions** when later running **`apply`**. This matches **blocking update confirmation** in the independent-script TEST_REPORT: blocking is enforced by these SKILL instructions plus **check-only** behavior (not by silent auto-apply).

**Strict check (Agent / IDE — recommended on `check`):** Use **`GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT=1`**. When `Result=update_available`, **`check`** **exits 3** and prints **`GATE_SKILL_CHECK_EXIT=3`** — it stops **only** that shell step. **Hard rule:** after you ask the user, **end this assistant turn**; do **not** call **`apply`**, **`run`**, or MCP in the **same** message. **`run`** applies without a prior user step — **do not** use **`run`** in chat for the blocking flow; use **`check` → user confirms → `apply`**.

### Step 1 — Check

**Install root:** `check` / `apply` read **`$DEST/SKILL.md`**. Typical **`$SKILL_ROOT`**: **`$HOME/.cursor/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.codex/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.openclaw/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.agents/skills/<name>/`**, **`$HOME/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>/`**. Single-arg: the script resolves **`DEST`** in that order when **`SKILL.md`** exists; otherwise **`DEST`** is `scripts/../`. Workspace-only trees need two-arg **`check`** / **`apply`** with explicit **`DEST`**.

**Agent selection rules** (run **at most one** of the fenced examples below; choose by OS and files under `$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/`):
- **macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash:** If `update-skill.sh` exists → use **only** the **Bash** example.
- **Windows (native PowerShell):** If `update-skill.ps1` exists → use **only** the **PowerShell** example.
- **Windows without `.ps1`** (typical ClawHub install): If only `update-skill.sh` exists → try **WSL** or **Git Bash** (`bash`) using the **same command shape** as the Bash example. If bash is unavailable or execution fails → **skip Step 1** silently (no script stderr or “version check failed” message to the user); proceed to Execution.
- **Neither script exists:** Skip Step 1 silently; proceed to Execution. Do **not** invent `GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN` or run `apply` / `revoke-pending`.

**Bash** (blocking — no auto; example Cursor):

```bash
GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT=1 bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-info-macroimpact/scripts/update-skill.sh" check "gate-info-macroimpact"
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
$env:GATE_SKILL_CHECK_STRICT = '1'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-info-macroimpact\scripts\update-skill.ps1" check "gate-info-macroimpact"
```

**Result semantics:** `skipped` = no action. `update_available` = remote newer; **with blocking flow, do not apply until the user agrees**. `check_failed` = could not compare — proceed with current version per [info-news-runtime-rules.md](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills/blob/master/skills/info-news-runtime-rules.md); **do not** surface technical check failure details to the user.

**Agent parse (stdout):** `GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_AGENT_ACTION=...`. **`BLOCK_UNTIL_USER_CONFIRMS_UPDATE`** → Step 2 before Execution. **`CONTINUE_SKILL_EXECUTION`** → no block from the check script.

### Step 2 — Confirm or Reject (blocking)

**Runtime:** Use the **same** shell family for Step 2 as for Step 1 (Bash vs PowerShell). If Step 1 was **skipped**, do **not** run `apply` or `revoke-pending`.

**If `update_available`:**

1. **STOP** — do NOT proceed to Execution yet.
2. Inform the user (e.g. newer version available; summarize if helpful).
3. **Wait for the user’s reply** — blocking step.

   **Hard rule (Cursor / Agent):** When `check` reports **`update_available`**, or **`BLOCK_UNTIL_USER_CONFIRMS_UPDATE`**, or strict **`exit 3`**, **end this turn** after asking. **Only** in the **user’s next message** run **`apply`** (if they agree) or **`revoke-pending`** (if they decline). Do **not** chain **`apply`** in the same turn as **`check`** for this flow.

   - User **agrees** → run **`apply`** with **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** from strict **`check`** stdout when required, then Execution.
   - User **declines** → **`revoke-pending`**, then Execution on the current install.

**Two-step gate (strict `check`):** **`apply`** / **`run`** (without **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`**) **fail** until **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** matches **`.gate-skill-apply-token`**. User decline → **`revoke-pending`**.

```bash
GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN="<paste from check stdout>" bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-info-macroimpact/scripts/update-skill.sh" apply "gate-info-macroimpact"
```

```bash
bash "$HOME/.cursor/skills/gate-info-macroimpact/scripts/update-skill.sh" revoke-pending "gate-info-macroimpact"
```

```powershell
$env:GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN = '<paste from check stdout>'
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-info-macroimpact\scripts\update-skill.ps1" apply "gate-info-macroimpact"
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor\skills\gate-info-macroimpact\scripts\update-skill.ps1" revoke-pending "gate-info-macroimpact"
```

**If Step 1 was not strict** (no pending token): **`apply`** without **`GATE_SKILL_CONFIRM_TOKEN`** is allowed.

**If `skipped` or `check_failed`:** no update step; proceed to Execution.

### Optional — `GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`

For **CI / unattended automation only**: setting **`GATE_SKILL_UPDATE_MODE=auto`** on **`check`** makes the script **apply immediately** when the remote is newer — **no** user confirmation and **incompatible** with **blocking update confirmation** tests. Do **not** use **`auto`** on **`check`** when reproducing the blocking PD flow.

### Parameters

- **name**: Frontmatter `name` above; must match `skills/<name>/` on gate-skills.
- **Invoke**: Use **`$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/update-skill.sh`** (or `.ps1`) where **`$SKILL_ROOT/SKILL.md`** is this skill — e.g. **`~/.cursor/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.codex/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.openclaw/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.agents/skills/<name>`**, **`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>`**; do not treat **`~/.cursor`** (or any host root without **`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`**) as the install. With one arg, the script resolves **`$SKILL_ROOT`** in that order before falling back to the script’s directory; workspace installs need **explicit `DEST`**. **Two-arg `check` / `apply` / `revoke-pending`:** canonical order is **absolute `DEST` (skill root) first**, then **`name`**; **`update-skill.sh` / `update-skill.ps1` auto-swap** when only one normalized path contains `SKILL.md` (e.g. agent passes `name` then path).
- **ClawHub vs full tree:** Installs without `update-skill.ps1` may copy it from [gate/gate-skills](https://github.com/gate/gate-skills) under `skills/<name>/scripts/` (**manual** only; agents must **not** auto-download).

**Do not** dump raw script logs into the user-facing reply except when debugging. On **`check` exit 3** (strict), do not run Execution until Step 2 is resolved. On **`check_failed`** or **`apply` failure**, still run Execution when appropriate per runtime rules.

| News only | "any crypto news" | Route to `gate-news-briefing` |
| Why price moved | "why did BTC crash" | Route to `gate-news-eventexplain` |

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 0: Multi-Dimension Intent Check

- If the query is about macro-economic impact on crypto, proceed with this Skill.
- If the query also mentions coin-specific fundamentals, risk check, or on-chain data beyond the macro angle, route to `gate-info-research` (if available).

### Step 1: Intent Recognition & Parameter Extraction

Extract from user input:

- `event_keyword`: Macro event/indicator name (e.g., "CPI", "non-farm payroll", "Fed meeting", "interest rate")
- `coin` (optional): Related coin (default: BTC if not specified)
- `time_range`: Time window for calendar/news (default: 7d for calendar, 24h for news)

If the macro event cannot be identified, ask the user to clarify — do not guess.

### Step 2: Call MCP Tools in Parallel

| Step | MCP Tool | Parameters | Retrieved Data | Parallel |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| 1a | `info_macro_get_economic_calendar` | `start_date={today}, end_date={today+14d}` | Upcoming economic events | Yes |
| 1b | `info_macro_get_macro_indicator` | `mode="latest", indicator={event_keyword}` | Latest value of the specific macro indicator | Yes |
| 1c | `news_feed_search_news` | `query={event_keyword}, limit=5, sort_by="importance"` | Related news articles | Yes |
| 1d | `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` | `symbol={coin}, timeframe="1d"` | Current market data for the correlated coin | Yes |

**Note:** If a specific indicator is not mentioned, use `info_macro_get_macro_summary` instead of `info_macro_get_macro_indicator` for Step 1b.

All four primary tools run in parallel when applicable.

### Step 3: LLM Aggregation

The LLM must:

- Match the user's query to relevant economic calendar events
- Compare actual vs forecast vs previous values (surprise factor)
- Correlate macro data with crypto price action
- Reference historical patterns where appropriate
- Combine with latest news for context

## Decision Logic

| Condition | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actual > Forecast (inflation metrics like CPI) | Hotter-than-expected — may delay rate cuts, bearish for risk assets |
| Actual < Forecast (inflation metrics) | Cooler-than-expected — supports rate cut narrative, bullish for risk assets |
| Actual > Forecast (employment data) | Stronger labor market — mixed (growth positive but rate cut delay) |
| Actual < Forecast (employment data) | Weakening labor market — supports cuts but signals slowdown |
| Event status = Pending | Upcoming — markets may position ahead of release |
| BTC 24h change > 5% coinciding with macro event | Significant move correlating with macro release |
| No related news found | Limited market commentary — event may not yet be widely covered |

---

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Handling |
|------------|----------|
| `info_macro_get_economic_calendar` fails | Skip calendar section; focus on indicator + news |
| `info_macro_get_macro_indicator` fails | Skip indicator detail; use calendar data if available |
| `news_feed_search_news` fails | Skip news section |
| `info_marketsnapshot_get_market_snapshot` fails | Skip market correlation section |
| All Tools fail | Return error; suggest user try again later |
| Indicator not found | Suggest similar indicators; ask user to clarify |
| No upcoming macro events | Inform user; show recent past events if available |

## Cross-Skill Routing

| User Follow-up Intent | Route To |
|-----------------------|----------|
| "Analyze BTC for me" | `gate-info-coinanalysis` |
| "What's the technical outlook?" | `gate-info-trendanalysis` |
| "How's the overall market?" | `gate-info-marketoverview` |
| "Why did BTC crash?" | `gate-news-eventexplain` |
| "What about DeFi impact?" | `gate-info-defianalysis` |
| "Any crypto news?" | `gate-news-briefing` |

## Safety Rules

1. **No price predictions**: Describe potential impacts and historical patterns, not specific price targets.
2. **Correlation ≠ causation**: State that macro–crypto links are probabilistic.
3. **Data transparency**: Label source, time, and reference period for each data point.
4. **No trading advice**: Do not recommend specific trades based on macro data.
5. **Flag uncertainty**: When data is pending, label forecast vs actual clearly.
6. **Historical patterns disclaimer**: Past performance does not guarantee future results.
7. **Age & eligibility**: Intended for users **aged 18 or above** with **full civil capacity** in their jurisdiction.
8. **Data flow**: The host agent processes user prompts; this skill directs **read-only** **Gate-Info** and **Gate-News** MCP tools listed above. The LLM synthesizes from tool results. Aside from those MCP calls and the documented skill-update flow (GitHub URLs in **General Rules** and `info-news-runtime-rules.md`), this skill does not invoke additional third-party data services.
