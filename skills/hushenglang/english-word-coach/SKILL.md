# English Word Coach

Vocabulary assistant with three capabilities: word analysis, vocabulary library management, and daily spaced-repetition review.

---

## Trigger Conditions

| User Input | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Single English word (e.g. `resilience`) | Mode 1: Analyze + collect |
| "收录 [word]" or "收录这个单词" | Mode 1: Analyze + collect |
| "复习" / "review" / "开始复习" | Mode 2: Daily review session |

---

## Mode 1: Word Analysis & Collection

Execute all three steps in order.

### Step 1 — Analyze the word

Output in this format (Chinese explanations + English examples):

```
## [word]  /[IPA phonetics]/

**词性 & 核心含义**
[part of speech]: [concise Chinese definition]

**工作场景常用搭配**
- [collocation phrase 1]：[Chinese meaning]
  → "[Professional-context example sentence]"
- [collocation phrase 2]：[Chinese meaning]
  → "[Professional-context example sentence]"
- [collocation phrase 3]：[Chinese meaning]
  → "[Professional-context example sentence]"

**词根记忆法**
词根：[root] = [Chinese meaning] ｜ 前缀/后缀：[affix] = [Chinese meaning]
同族词：[related1]（[meaning1]）· [related2]（[meaning2]）· [related3]（[meaning3]）
记忆口诀：[mnemonic tip in Chinese, ≤ 20 chars]
```

### Step 2 — Save to `memory/ENGLISH_WORDS.md`

1. Read `memory/ENGLISH_WORDS.md` (create with header below if it doesn't exist).
2. Check if the word already exists (case-insensitive). If yes, inform the user and skip.
3. Append a new row with `Review Count = 0`, `Last Review = -`, `Next Review = tomorrow`, `Interval = 1`.

**File header (use when creating):**
```markdown
# English Word Vocabulary

| Word | Date Added | Review Count | Last Review | Next Review | Interval (days) |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
```

**Row format:**
```
| [word] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | 0 | - | [YYYY-MM-DD +1 day] | 1 |
```

### Step 3 — Report today's count

Count rows added today (matching today's date in `Date Added`) and total rows in `memory/ENGLISH_WORDS.md`, then output:

> 📚 今日已收录 **[today_count]** 个单词（累计 **[total]** 个）

If `today_count > 5`, append a gentle reminder on the next line:

> 💡 今日收录较多，建议放缓节奏，让记忆巩固一下～

---

## Mode 2: Daily Review Session

### Sub-mode: Start or Resume

- If `memory/DAILY_REVIEW_YYYYMMDD.md` (today's date) exists and `Status` is `In Progress`, **resume** from the next unanswered question — do NOT regenerate questions.
- Otherwise, generate a fresh plan (Sub-mode: Generate plan below).

### Sub-mode: Generate plan

1. Read `memory/ENGLISH_WORDS.md`.
2. Select words where `Next Review <= today` (sorted by `Next Review` ascending). If fewer than 5, fill up to 5 by adding words with the smallest review counts.
3. Pick exactly **5 words**.
4. Generate **10 questions** — 2 per word (one MCQ + one Fill-blank), then **shuffle across groups** so each group covers different words:

**Two question types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| MCQ | Multiple-choice, 4 options A–D; test meaning or usage in context |
| Fill-blank | `___` in a sentence; answer is the word |

**Shuffle rule:** Arrange the 10 questions into 5 groups of 2 so that **each group contains questions from 2 different words**. No group may have 2 questions about the same word. Each group contains one MCQ and one Fill-blank.

Example layout for words W1–W5:
```
Group 1: W1-MCQ,    W2-Fill
Group 2: W2-MCQ,    W3-Fill
Group 3: W3-MCQ,    W4-Fill
Group 4: W4-MCQ,    W5-Fill
Group 5: W5-MCQ,    W1-Fill
```

5. Write `memory/DAILY_REVIEW_YYYYMMDD.md`:

```markdown
# Daily Review - YYYY-MM-DD

## Words for Today
[word1], [word2], [word3], [word4], [word5]

## Questions

### Group 1

#### Q1 (MCQ)
[Sentence testing wordA meaning/usage]
A. [option]　B. [option]　C. [option]*　D. [option]
Answer: C [wordA]

#### Q2 (Fill-blank)
[Sentence with ___ where wordB belongs]
Answer: [wordB]

[... Groups 2–5 following the same shuffle pattern ...]

## Progress
Completed: 0/10
Status: In Progress
```

### Sub-mode: Conduct review (one question per turn)

1. Present the **current question** using a neutral heading like `**Question N/10**` — do NOT show the question's `#### QN` heading or any word label. Hide the answer line. Show only the question stem and options/prompt.
2. Wait for the user's reply.
3. **Strictly verify the user's answer against the correct answer in the file before responding:**
   - For MCQ: compare the user's chosen letter (A/B/C/D) exactly against the correct letter in the `Answer:` line. Only mark correct if they match exactly.
   - For Fill-blank: compare the user's word against the answer (case-insensitive). Only mark correct if the word matches.
   - ✅ **正确！** + one-sentence explanation (only when the answer is genuinely correct)
   - ❌ **不对。** 正确答案是 [X]。[one-sentence explanation] (whenever the answer does not match)
4. Update `Completed: N/10` in the daily review file.
5. Present the **next question** automatically.

### Sub-mode: Complete session

After Q10 is answered:

1. Update `memory/DAILY_REVIEW_YYYYMMDD.md`: change `Completed: 10/10` and `Status: In Progress` → `Status: ✅ Completed YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.
2. For each of the 5 reviewed words, update `memory/ENGLISH_WORDS.md`:
   - `Review Count` += 1
   - `Last Review` = today
   - `Next Review` = today + interval from table below
   - `Interval` = new interval (days)
3. Output a completion summary.

## Spaced Repetition Intervals

| Review Count (after this session) | Next Review Interval |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 3 days |
| 2 | 7 days |
| 3 | 14 days |
| 4 | 30 days |
| ≥ 5 | 60 days |

## Rules

- Always **read** a file before writing to avoid overwriting existing content.
- The `memory/` directory is relative to the **current working directory**. Create it if absent.
- Never delete or modify rows in `ENGLISH_WORDS.md` except when updating review stats after a completed session.
- Do NOT reveal the answer line when presenting a question to the user.
- If the vocabulary has fewer than 5 words when review is triggered, use all available words and adjust question count to `words × 2`.
