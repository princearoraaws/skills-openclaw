description: Structured review checklist for OpenClaw skill files. Scores each SKILL.md on 5 quality dimensions (clarity, completeness, authenticity, examples, freshness) and generates a markdown report. All output is read-only — produces a review log, never edits skill files directly. Requires grep and curl (standard on Linux/macOS). Use manually or as a periodic reminder to audit your skills. Not an automated fixer — it identifies problems for you to decide what to change.

# Skill Refiner

A read-only review checklist for keeping skill files in good shape.

## What This Does (and Doesn't)

**Does:**
- Reads every SKILL.md in your workspace
- Scores each on 5 quality dimensions
- Flags specific problems (stale links, broken references, missing examples)
- Writes a review report to `memory/skill-refiner-log.md`

**Does NOT:**
- Edit any skill files (all output goes to the log — you decide what to change)
- Publish or push anything
- Make network requests beyond optional link checking (which you control)
- Require any API keys or credentials

This is a linter for skill files, not an auto-fixer.

## Requirements

Standard tools only — nothing to install:

| Tool | Used For | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `grep` | Finding patterns in SKILL.md files | `which grep` (preinstalled on Linux/macOS) |
| `curl` | Optional link freshness check | `which curl` (preinstalled on most systems) |
| `python3` | Frontmatter validation | `python3 --version` (3.8+) |

No API keys, no credentials, no network access required for the core review. The link checker (Step 5) makes HTTP HEAD requests to URLs found in your skill files — skip that step if you want zero network activity.

## The Review Process

### Step 1: Frontmatter Audit (no network)

Read the YAML block at the top of each SKILL.md and check against this list:

```
□ name field matches the directory name
□ description accurately reflects current functionality
□ description is under 300 characters
□ description includes "NOT for X" if common misuse exists
□ no stale version numbers in description text
```

How to check programmatically:

```bash
# List all skill frontmatter for manual review
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  echo "=== $(dirname "$f" | xargs basename) ==="
  sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p' "$f"
  echo ""
done
```

**Log format:** For each skill, note pass/fail on each checkbox. Example:
```
prompt-crafter: name ✅ | description ✅ | length ✅ | NOT-for ✅ | versions ✅
```

### Step 2: Content Scoring (no network)

Score each skill on 5 dimensions, 1-5 scale:

| Dimension | Score 5 | Score 3 | Score 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Clarity** | Usable without follow-up questions | Some assumptions, mostly clear | Vague, requires guessing |
| **Completeness** | Edge cases and limitations covered | Happy path plus some warnings | Only happy path |
| **Authenticity** | Has opinions, warnings, real stories | Informative but generic | Reads like auto-generated docs |
| **Examples** | Copy-paste code that works | Code snippets need modification | Pseudocode or no examples |
| **Freshness** | Tested recently, links work | Mostly current, minor drift | References deprecated tools |

**Scoring rules:**
- Be specific about why a dimension scored below 4 ("missing example for error handling" not "needs work")
- Don't inflate scores — a 3 that you call a 4 just delays fixing it
- Target: 20/25 per skill. Below 15 = major rewrite needed

### Step 3: Reference Validation (no network)

Check that files mentioned in SKILL.md actually exist:

```bash
# Find file references and verify they exist
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  dir=$(dirname "$f")
  echo "=== $(basename "$dir") ==="
  grep -oP '(?:references|scripts)/[\w.-]+' "$f" | while read ref; do
    [ -f "$dir/$ref" ] && echo "  ✅ $ref" || echo "  ❌ $ref — MISSING"
  done
done
```

### Step 4: Code Example Check (no network)

Verify code fences have language tags and referenced commands exist locally:

```bash
# Check for untagged code blocks
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  count=$(grep -c '^```$' "$f" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$count" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  $(basename "$(dirname "$f")"): $count untagged code block(s)"
  fi
done

# Check referenced CLI tools exist
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  echo "=== $(basename "$(dirname "$f")") ==="
  grep -oP '(?<=\$ )[\w-]+' "$f" 2>/dev/null | sort -u | while read cmd; do
    command -v "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1 \
      && echo "  ✅ $cmd" \
      || echo "  ⚠️  $cmd — not found locally"
  done
done
```

### Step 5: Link Freshness (optional — makes network requests)

**⚠️ This step sends HTTP HEAD requests to every URL in your skill files.** Skip it if you want zero network activity. Only URLs already written in your SKILL.md files are checked — no external discovery.

```bash
# Optional: check if URLs in skill files are reachable
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  echo "=== $(basename "$(dirname "$f")") ==="
  grep -oP 'https?://[^\s)>"'\'']+' "$f" 2>/dev/null | sort -u | while read url; do
    status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 -I "$url" 2>/dev/null)
    case "$status" in
      200|301|302) echo "  ✅ $url" ;;
      000) echo "  ⚠️  $url — timeout" ;;
      *) echo "  ❌ $url — HTTP $status" ;;
    esac
  done
done
```

Run this monthly, not weekly. Most links don't break that fast and you'll avoid unnecessary requests.

## Writing the Review Log

After running through Steps 1-5, compile results into a single markdown file:

```markdown
## Skill Review — 2026-03-16

### Scores
| Skill | Clarity | Complete | Authentic | Examples | Fresh | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| prompt-crafter | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 24 ✅ |
| site-deployer | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 22 ✅ |
| markdown-toolkit | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 22 ✅ |

### Issues Found
- site-deployer: Vercel CLI reference says v33, current is v34 (freshness -1)
- markdown-toolkit: `references/advanced.md` referenced but missing (completeness -1)

### Recommendations (for human review)
- site-deployer: Update CLI version in deploy command
- markdown-toolkit: Either create the missing reference file or remove the mention
- All skills: Run link checker next month

### No Action Needed
- prompt-crafter: All checks passed
```

Save to `memory/skill-refiner-log.md`. Append each review — don't overwrite — so you can track improvement over time.

## Running This

### Manual (recommended for first use)
Walk through Steps 1-4 on each skill. Write the log. Review what you found. Make changes yourself based on the findings.

### As a periodic reminder
Set a cron that creates the review report for you to read:

```
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Skill Review Reminder" \
  --cron "0 16 * * 0" \
  --tz "America/Denver" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Run the skill review checklist from skills/publish/skill-refiner/SKILL.md. Read each SKILL.md in skills/publish/*/. Score on 5 dimensions. Write the report to memory/skill-refiner-log.md. Do NOT edit any skill files — report only."
```

**Important:** The cron message explicitly says "report only, do not edit." This ensures the automated run produces a log you review, not changes you discover after the fact.

## What NOT to Do

1. **Don't auto-edit skill files from a cron.** Generate the report, review it yourself, then make changes. Unreviewed automated edits are how you get broken skills in production.
2. **Don't chase perfection.** A skill scoring 22/25 is fine. Spend time on the ones below 16.
3. **Don't rewrite for style.** If it works and users aren't confused, leave it. "Better phrasing" is a time sink with no user impact.
4. **Don't delete content.** If something seems outdated, move it to a notes section rather than removing it. You might need it as reference later.
