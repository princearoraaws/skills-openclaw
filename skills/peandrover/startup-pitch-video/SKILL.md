# Startup Pitch Video Maker — Create Investor Pitch and Demo Day Presentation Videos

Describe your startup and NemoVideo creates the pitch video. Seed round, Series A, demo day, YC application — narrate the problem, the solution, the traction, and the ask, and get a pitch video that communicates your vision clearly to investors who see hundreds of decks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for startup fundraising and pitch content:
- Create investor pitch videos for seed and Series A fundraising
- Film demo day presentation videos for Y Combinator, Techstars, and accelerators
- Build product demo videos showing your core workflow for investor due diligence
- Document traction milestones and growth metrics for investor updates
- Create "why we're building this" founder story videos
- Produce application videos for grants, competitions, and accelerator programs

## How to Describe Your Startup Pitch

Be specific about the problem, solution, market size, traction, and what makes your team the right one.

**Examples of good prompts:**
- "B2B SaaS pitch: We help operations teams at mid-market companies (50-500 employees) reduce manual data entry by 80%. The problem: companies spend $47K/year average on data entry labor that could be automated. Our solution: AI that watches how your team works and automates the repetitive parts without requiring any integration setup. Traction: 23 paying customers, $18K MRR, 140% net revenue retention. Raising $1.5M seed round."
- "Consumer app for YC application: We're building the tool we wish existed when we were athletes. Sports performance tracking that actually gives you actionable insights, not just raw numbers. 3,400 athletes using it, 62% return weekly. My co-founder and I were D1 athletes who spent years frustrated by every existing tool."
- "Marketplace pitch for demo day: Connecting licensed electricians directly with homeowners for small jobs that bigger companies ignore. The 2-hour job that nobody returns your call on. 180 electricians on platform, 1,200 homeowners, $340K GMV in 6 months, 4.8 star average."

      "prompt": "Y Combinator demo day pitch — 2 minutes exactly: Company is AthleteOS.

  }'
```

## Tips for Best Results

- **One sentence problem, quantified**: "Companies spend $47K/year on data entry" beats "data entry is inefficient" — investors need a number to benchmark the market
- **Traction is more convincing than vision**: Lead with what's real (MRR, customers, growth rate) before describing the future
- **Team slide earns the meeting**: "ex-Meta ads team" or "D1 athletes who lived the problem" — relevant founder background in one sentence
- **Match the timing to the format**: YC application = 2 minutes maximum; seed round investor email = 90 seconds; demo day = 2-3 minutes
- **The ask should be specific**: "$2M seed, 18 months runway, to hire 2 engineers and double our go-to-market" is better than "raising a seed round"

## Output Formats

| Format | Resolution | Duration |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Investor email | 1920×1080 | 90–120s |
| Demo day stage | 1920×1080 | 2–3 min |
| YC/accelerator app | 1920×1080 | 2 min max |
| LinkedIn | 1920×1080 | 1–3 min |

## Common Questions

**How long should a pitch video be?**
YC application: 2 minutes hard limit. Demo day: 2-3 minutes. Investor cold outreach: 90 seconds. Set `duration_minutes` to match the specific format.

**Should I include product demos in the pitch video?**
For technical products, a 30-second product demo clip embedded in the pitch is more convincing than slides. Describe "show the product in action for 30 seconds at the 1:30 mark."

**What if I don't have traction yet?**
Pre-traction pitches should emphasize problem validation (interviews, waitlist size, letters of intent) and team credibility. Be honest about stage — investors respect clarity about where you are.
