description: Answer questions about the MOVA specification language — schemas (ds.*), envelopes (env.*), verbs, episodes, global catalogs, instruction profiles, and the operator frame. Use when the user asks how to write a MOVA artifact, wants to understand any MOVA concept, or needs to validate whether something follows the MOVA spec. Reads from the local workspace spec clone and the public GitHub repo.

# MOVA Spec Guide

Answer any question about the MOVA language — from basic concepts to schema-level validation — by reading the canonical spec documents in the workspace and referencing the public repository.

## What this skill does

1. **Explains MOVA concepts** — schemas (`ds.*`), envelopes (`env.*`), verbs, episodes, global catalogs, instruction profiles, runtime bindings, connectors, security layer, text/UI layer
2. **Reads authoritative source docs** — uses the local spec clone for immediate access; references the public GitHub repo for the canonical latest state
3. **Shows examples** — points to `examples/` files and explains them in context
4. **Validates artifacts** — given a JSON draft, checks it against the relevant MOVA schema and explains violations
5. **Maps concepts to practice** — explains how a concept applies to a real use case the user brings

## Source hierarchy

| Priority | Source | Use for |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 (primary) | Local workspace: `/home/mova/.openclaw/workspace/mova-spec/` | All reads — fast and always available |
| 2 (canonical reference) | GitHub: `https://github.com/mova-compact/mova-spec` | Latest version check, stable URLs to share |

**Always read from the local workspace first.** Only reference the GitHub repo if the user needs a link to share or asks about the latest uncommitted changes.

## Core MOVA concepts (quick map)

| Concept | What it is | Where defined |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| `ds.*` schema | JSON Schema describing what data looks like | `schemas/ds.*.schema.json` |
| `env.*` envelope | Typed speech-act: a request, command, or event over `ds.*` data | `schemas/env.*.schema.json` |
| Verb | Abstract operation type: create, update, route, record, publish, analyze, ... | `docs/mova_global_and_verbs.md` |
| Tool | Execution channel (`tool_id`); `0` = tool-less | `docs/mova_global_and_verbs.md §4.5` |
| Action signature | Atomic unit for policy: `(verb_id, tool_id, target_kind?)` | `MOVA_6.0.0_RELEASE_NOTES.md` |
| Episode | Structured record of one meaningful work step | `ds.mova_episode_core_v1` |
| Instruction profile | Declarative policy and guardrail set for an executor | `ds.instruction_profile_core_v1` |
| Global catalog | Shared vocabulary for all layers | `global.*.json` |
| Operator frame | 13-axis audit lens (what/how/where/when/why/...) | `docs/mova_operator_frame.md` |
| Genetic layer | Pattern memory built from episodes over time | `docs/mova_episodes_and_genetic_layer.md` |

## How to handle different question types

### Concept question
Read the relevant `docs/` file. Summarize the answer. Quote the exact definition. Show a minimal example if one exists in `examples/`.

### Schema question
Read the relevant `schemas/*.schema.json`. Explain each field: type, required/optional, allowed values. Show how the field relates to the concept.

### Validation question
Read the user's JSON. Read the target schema. Check required fields, field types, allowed enum values. Report each violation with the relevant schema field and rule.

### How to write question
Read the most relevant `docs/` file. Walk through a minimal valid instance step by step. Reference the `examples/` file if it exists.

### Catalog lookup
Read the relevant `global.*.json`. Quote the exact entry. Explain the purpose in one sentence.

## MOVA version

Current version in the workspace: **MOVA 6.0.0**

Key additions in 6.0.0 (see `MOVA_6.0.0_RELEASE_NOTES.md`):
- Normative definition of `verb`, `tool`, `action_signature`
- `tool_id = 0` is canonical for tool-less actions
- Policy matching priority: `action_signature > verb_id > tool_id`
- `action_labels` in domain dictionaries (readability, no normative weight)

## Rules

- NEVER invent schema field names, verb IDs, or catalog values — always read from workspace files
- NEVER reference schema URLs without first reading the local file to confirm the content
- If the user asks about a concept not yet defined in the spec — say so explicitly, do not improvise
- Always cite which document and section the answer comes from
- If the user provides a JSON artifact to validate — read the correct schema file first, then compare field by field
- MOVA does not execute — never describe MOVA artifacts as having runtime behavior
