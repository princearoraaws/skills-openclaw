# FlowDo

FlowDo brings kanban-style task management to your terminal. Track tasks through workflow states, set priorities, and monitor your completion rate.

## Why FlowDo?

- **Workflow states**: Move tasks through todo → doing → done
- **Priority system**: Mark urgent tasks as high priority
- **Visual status**: Icons show task state at a glance
- **Completion tracking**: See your progress percentage
- **Filter views**: Show only tasks in a specific state
- **Zero config**: Works immediately, data stored locally

## Commands

- `add <text>` — Add a new task
- `list [status]` — List tasks filtered by status (todo/doing/done/all)
- `done <id>` — Mark a task as complete
- `doing <id>` — Mark a task as in progress
- `priority <id> <level>` — Set priority (high/normal/low)
- `stats` — View completion statistics
- `info` — Version information
- `help` — Show available commands

## Usage Examples

```bash
flowdo add Write project proposal
flowdo add Review pull requests
flowdo doing 1710000001
flowdo priority 1710000001 high
flowdo done 1710000001
flowdo list todo

```

## Status Icons

- ⬜ Todo — Not started
- 🔄 Doing — In progress
- ✅ Done — Completed
- 🚫 Blocked — Blocked by dependency
- ❗ High priority indicator
