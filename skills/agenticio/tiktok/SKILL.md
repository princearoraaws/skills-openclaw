# TikTok

TikTok content system. Stop the scroll, build your audience.

## Critical Privacy & Safety

### Data Storage (CRITICAL)
- **All content data stored locally only**: `memory/tiktok/`
- **No TikTok API connection** - manual data entry only
- **No content posting** through this skill
- **No automation** of TikTok interactions
- User controls all data retention and deletion

### Safety Boundaries (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- ✅ Generate content ideas and hooks
- ✅ Write scripts and captions
- ✅ Build posting strategies
- ✅ Track manually-entered analytics
- ❌ **NEVER guarantee** viral success or growth
- ❌ **NEVER automate** posting or engagement
- ❌ **NEVER replace** creative judgment
- ❌ **NEVER share** content externally

### Content Guidelines
All generated content must comply with TikTok Community Guidelines. User is responsible for final content decisions and posting.

## Quick Start

### Data Storage Setup
TikTok content data stored in your local workspace:
- `memory/tiktok/ideas.json` - Content ideas and hooks
- `memory/tiktok/scripts.json` - Video scripts
- `memory/tiktok/posting_schedule.json` - Posting calendar
- `memory/tiktok/analytics.json` - Performance tracking
- `memory/tiktok/niche.json` - Niche definition and audience

Use provided scripts in `scripts/` for all data operations.

## Core Workflows

### Generate Content Idea
```
User: "Give me video ideas for finance content"
→ Use scripts/generate_ideas.py --niche finance --count 5
→ Generate platform-native ideas with hook angles
```

### Write Hook
```
User: "Write a hook for my sleep tips video"
→ Use scripts/write_hook.py --topic "sleep tips" --style curiosity
→ Generate 5 hook variations with explanations
```

### Create Script
```
User: "Script for 60-second video about investing"
→ Use scripts/create_script.py --topic investing --length 60
→ Write paced script with micro-commitments
```

### Build Posting Schedule
```
User: "Create a posting schedule for next month"
→ Use scripts/build_schedule.py --frequency 3 --days "Mon,Wed,Fri"
→ Generate realistic content calendar
```

### Log Analytics
```
User: "My video got 10K views with 45% completion"
→ Use scripts/log_analytics.py --video-id "VID-123" --views 10000 --completion 45
→ Track performance and identify patterns
```
