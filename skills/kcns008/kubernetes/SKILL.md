# Cluster Agent Swarm — Complete Platform Operations

## ⚠️ Runtime Requirements & Credentials Required Before Use

This skill package provides powerful Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster management capabilities but **requires specific credentials and runtime configurations** before it can function. Installers must configure these prerequisites:

### Cluster Access
| Requirement | Description | Environment Variable |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Kubeconfig** | Valid kubeconfig file with cluster access | `KUBECONFIG` or `~/.kube/config` |
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes CLI installed and configured | Must be in PATH |
| **oc** | OpenShift CLI (for OpenShift clusters) | Must be in PATH |

### Cloud Provider Credentials
| Platform | Required Credentials | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| **AWS/EKS/ROSA** | AWS credentials with EKS/ROSA access | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, optionally `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` |
| **Azure/ARO** | Azure authentication | `az login` or `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID` |
| **GCP/GKE** | GCP authentication | `gcloud auth application-default login` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |

### External Service Integrations
| Service | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **ArgoCD** | Recommended | Server URL + auth token for GitOps sync/management |
| **Prometheus** | Recommended | URL for metric queries |
| **Loki/Elasticsearch** | Optional | URL for log queries |
| **HashiCorp Vault** | Optional | Token or Kubernetes auth for secrets |
| **Container Registry** | Optional | Auth for image scanning/promotion |

### Session Setup
Before using the agents, you **MUST** set up a session context:
```bash
# Set up session context for your environment
bash skills/orchestrator/scripts/setup-session.sh <environment> [context-name]

# Environments: dev, qa, staging, prod
# Note: prod requires human approval for all modifications
```

### Security Considerations
- Agents operate with **least privilege** by default
- All credential access is logged
- Production modifications require human approval
- Secrets are never logged or stored in code

# Artifacts - Cache (registries, SBOM, promotions)
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills/skills/artifacts

# Developer Experience - Desk (namespaces, onboarding)
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills/skills/developer-experience

# QMD - Local Markdown Search (notes, docs, knowledge bases)
npx skills add https://github.com/kcns008/cluster-agent-swarm-skills/skills/qmd

## The Swarm — Agent Roster

| Agent | Code Name | Session Key | Domain |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Orchestrator | Jarvis | `agent:platform:orchestrator` | Task routing, coordination, standups |
| Cluster Ops | Atlas | `agent:platform:cluster-ops` | Cluster lifecycle, nodes, upgrades |
| GitOps | Flow | `agent:platform:gitops` | ArgoCD, Helm, Kustomize, deploys |
| Security | Shield | `agent:platform:security` | RBAC, policies, secrets, scanning |
| Observability | Pulse | `agent:platform:observability` | Metrics, logs, alerts, incidents |
| Artifacts | Cache | `agent:platform:artifacts` | Registries, SBOM, promotion, CVEs |
| Developer Experience | Desk | `agent:platform:developer-experience` | Namespaces, onboarding, support |

## Agent Capabilities Summary

### What Agents CAN Do
- Read cluster state (`kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, `oc get`)
- Deploy via GitOps (`argocd app sync`, Flux reconciliation)
- Create documentation and reports
- Investigate and triage incidents
- Provision standard resources (namespaces, quotas, RBAC)
- Run health checks and audits
- Scan images and generate SBOMs
- Query metrics and logs
- Execute pre-approved runbooks

### What Agents CANNOT Do (Human-in-the-Loop Required)
- Delete production resources (`kubectl delete` in prod)
- Modify cluster-wide policies (NetworkPolicy, OPA, Kyverno cluster policies)
- Make direct changes to secrets without rotation workflow
- Modify network routes or service mesh configuration
- Scale beyond defined resource limits
- Perform irreversible cluster upgrades
- Approve production deployments (can prepare, human approves)
- Change RBAC at cluster-admin level

---

## Communication Patterns

### @Mentions
Agents communicate via @mentions in shared task comments:
```
@Shield Please review the RBAC for payment-service v3.2 before I sync.
@Pulse Is the CPU spike related to the deployment or external traffic?
@Atlas The staging cluster needs 2 more worker nodes.
```

### Thread Subscriptions
- Commenting on a task → auto-subscribe
- Being @mentioned → auto-subscribe
- Being assigned → auto-subscribe
- Once subscribed → receive ALL future comments on heartbeat

### Escalation Path
1. Agent detects issue
2. Agent attempts resolution within guardrails
3. If blocked → @mention another agent or escalate to human
4. P1 incidents → all relevant agents auto-notified

---

## Heartbeat Schedule

Agents wake on staggered 5-minute intervals:
```
*/5  * * * *  Atlas   (Cluster Ops - needs fast response for incidents)
*/5  * * * *  Pulse   (Observability - needs fast response for alerts)
*/5  * * * *  Shield  (Security - fast response for CVEs and threats)
*/10 * * * *  Flow    (GitOps - deployments can wait a few minutes)
*/10 * * * *  Cache   (Artifacts - promotions are scheduled)
*/15 * * * *  Desk    (DevEx - developer requests aren't usually urgent)
*/15 * * * *  Orchestrator (Coordination - overview and standups)
```

---

## Key Principles

- **Roles over genericism** — Each agent has a defined SOUL with exactly who they are
- **Files over mental notes** — Only files persist between sessions
- **Staggered schedules** — Don't wake all agents at once
- **Shared context** — One source of truth for tasks and communication
- **Heartbeat, not always-on** — Balance responsiveness with cost
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Critical actions require approval
- **Guardrails over freedom** — Define what agents can and cannot do
- **Audit everything** — Every action logged to activity feed
- **Reliability first** — System stability always wins over new features
- **Security by default** — Deny access, approve by exception
