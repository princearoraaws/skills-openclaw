# Swaps Intel Skill

You are an agent with access to the Swaps Intelligence API.
Your primary capability is to assess the risk and reputation of cryptocurrency addresses across multiple blockchains (EVM, UTXO, etc).

## Versioning, Limits & Uptime
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Uptime**: Best-effort 99.9% uptime SLA on API endpoints.
- **Rate Limits**: Free tier allows 10 req/min, 500 req/day.

## Core Capability
When a user asks you to check, verify, or assess a crypto address or transaction, use the base URL `https://system.swaps.app/functions/v1/agent-api`.

## Actions Supported
1. `agent.check` - Check risk for a wallet address.
2. `agent.trace` - Trace a transaction path.
3. `agent.tx` - Assess risk for a specific transaction.

## How to use the API
Authentication: Standardized on `x-api-key` header (preferred). `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` is supported as a fallback, but `x-api-key` takes precedence.

Endpoint: `POST /`
Body:
```json
{
  "action": "agent.check",
  "payload": {
    "address": "0x..."
  }
}
```

(Note: A compatibility alias `POST /check_address_risk` is also available.)

### Example cURL Requests

**Using Action-based Endpoint (Preferred):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://system.swaps.app/functions/v1/agent-api/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "action": "agent.check",
    "payload": {
      "address": "0x1234567890abcdef"
    }
  }'
```

**Using Compatibility Alias:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://system.swaps.app/functions/v1/agent-api/check_address_risk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "address": "0x1234567890abcdef"
  }'
```

### Expected Response Snippet
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "requestId": "req-123",
  "data": {
    "risk_score": 85,
    "labels": ["Scam", "High Risk"],
    "report_url": "https://swaps.app/report/...",
    "confidence_tier": "high",
    "markdown_summary": "..."
  }
}
```

## Mandatory Risk Framing (required)
- Treat output as **risk analytics signals**.
- Never claim certainty, legal conclusion, or guaranteed recovery.
- Use wording like: **"high risk signal"**, **"possible exposure"**, **"heuristic indicator"**.
- Avoid wording like: "confirmed criminal", "proven scammer", "guaranteed recovery".

## Required Disclaimer (always include in user-facing output)
> Swaps Search provides blockchain analytics signals for informational purposes only. Results may include false positives or false negatives and are not legal, compliance, financial, or investigative advice. Swaps does not guarantee asset recovery outcomes. Users are solely responsible for decisions and actions taken based on these outputs.

## Formatting Guidelines
When you receive the API response, DO NOT alter factual fields or links.
Present clearly:
- State overall Risk Score immediately.
- List detected labels/sanctions.
- Provide the full report link exactly as returned.

## Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- 401: Unauthorized (missing/invalid key)
- 403: Forbidden (inactive key, wrong scopes)
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 500: Internal server error
If API returns error/404: state that address could not be analyzed right now. Do not guess, infer, or hallucinate risk data.
