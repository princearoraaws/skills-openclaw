- `applied` — Application submitted
- `phone_screen` — Initial recruiter call
- `technical` — Technical interview round
- `onsite` — On-site or final round
- `offer` — Offer received
- `negotiating` — In negotiation
- `accepted` — Offer accepted
- `rejected` — Application rejected
- `withdrawn` — Withdrew application

## Common Workflows

**Apply to a new job:**

1. `research_company` to understand culture and interview style
2. `match_job` to check resume-job fit score
3. `analyze_resume_gaps` to find missing keywords
4. `optimize_resume_for_job` to tailor resume
5. `generate_cover_letter` for the application
6. `add_job_application` to track it

**Prepare for an interview:**

1. `research_company` for culture and recent news
2. `generate_interview_questions` for likely questions
3. Use `placed-interview-coach` skill for mock sessions

**Negotiate an offer:**

1. `get_salary_insights` to benchmark the offer
2. `generate_negotiation_script` with your justifications
3. Use the conservative, balanced, or aggressive script based on your situation

**Track your pipeline:**

1. `list_job_applications` to see all applications
2. `update_job_status` as applications progress
3. `get_application_analytics` to see conversion rates and identify bottlenecks

## Tips

- Add applications immediately after submitting — tracking is most useful when complete
- Run `match_job` before applying to prioritize high-fit opportunities
- `generate_linkedin_profile` works best when your resume is fully updated first
- `get_salary_insights` returns more accurate data when you specify company + location + years of experience
- Use `analyze_resume_gaps` before `optimize_resume_for_job` to understand what's missing
