## Interview Types

### Technical Interviews (Coding)

To start a mock interview:
```
start_interview_session(
  resume_id="your-resume-id",
  job_title="Senior Software Engineer",
  difficulty="hard",
  company="Google"
)
```

To answer each question:
```
continue_interview_session(
  session_id="session-123",
  user_answer="I would use a hash map to store key-value pairs for O(1) lookup..."
)
```

To get feedback on performance:
```
get_interview_feedback(session_id="session-123")
```

### System Design Interviews

To list available cases:
```
list_interview_cases()
# Returns: Design Twitter, Design URL Shortener, Design Netflix, Design Uber, etc.
```

To start a system design session:
```
start_system_design(
  case_id="design-twitter",
  difficulty="senior"
)
```

**System Design Framework:**
1. **Requirements Clarification** — Functional and non-functional requirements
2. **High-Level Architecture** — Components, data flow, APIs
3. **Database Design** — Schema, indexing, replication, sharding
4. **Scalability** — Load balancing, caching, CDN, horizontal scaling
5. **Fault Tolerance** — Redundancy, failover, monitoring
6. **Trade-offs** — CAP theorem, consistency vs. availability

### Behavioral Interviews

To get behavioral questions for a target role:
```
get_behavioral_questions(
  target_role="Engineering Manager",
  focus_categories=["leadership", "conflict-resolution", "failure"]
)
```

**STAR Method** — Structure every answer:
- **Situation** — Context and background
- **Task** — Your responsibility and challenge
- **Action** — What you did specifically
- **Result** — Outcome with metrics

### Story Banking

To save STAR stories for reuse across interviews:
```
save_story_to_bank(
  situation="Led team through major refactor",
  task="Reduce technical debt while shipping features",
  action="Created phased plan, mentored junior devs, set clear milestones",
  result="30% faster deployments, improved morale, reduced bugs by 25%",
  category="leadership"
)
```

## Interview Flow

1. **Prepare** — Research company, review resume, practice with resources
2. **Start Session** — Begin mock interview with your resume and target role
3. **Answer Questions** — Think out loud, explain your reasoning
4. **Get Feedback** — Review performance after each question
5. **Iterate** — Practice multiple times, improve weak areas
6. **Save Stories** — Bank STAR stories for behavioral interviews

## Tips

**Technical Interviews:**
- Clarify requirements before diving into code
- Discuss trade-offs (time vs. space, simplicity vs. optimization)
- Test your solution with examples
- Explain your thought process

**System Design:**
- Start with requirements and constraints
- Draw diagrams and explain components
- Discuss scalability bottlenecks
- Consider failure scenarios

**Behavioral:**
- Use STAR method consistently
- Include specific metrics and outcomes
- Show growth and learning
- Be authentic and honest
